# React Router DOM steps 
- install using npm i react-router-dom
- in main.jsx import { BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom' and wrap the app in it
- In App.jsx import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
- make <Routes> (collection of routes) and inside it add <Route/>
- in <Route/> add path(where to go) and element(what to render) attributes
- In Navbar use <Link> instead of <a> tag to redirect to any specific route
- Make Navbar component and add it before <Routes> in App.jsx
- Nested Routes can be made by writing in this way - path="product/men"
- Dynamic Routes can be made by writing in this way - path="/about/:id"
- You can access the id by using useParams hook in that component you rendered in dynamic route
